# "Digital Humanities 150" FAQ

This is an FAQ for undergraduate students in my Digital Humanities 150 course (Spring 2020) at the University of Victoria. I'll circulate the full course outline in early January. 

## What Will We Study? 

This course is an introduction to the study and practice of media in the context of digital culture. We'll consider how audio, image, and text are designed and how they play a role in storytelling and fiction. This means we'll read but also watch, play, and listen to assigned materials.

Examples of these materials include: 
* Games such as [*Undertale*](https://undertale.com/) by Toby Fox and Temmie Chang and [*Gone Home*](https://gonehome.game/) by the Fulbright Company 
* Comics such as [*My Favorite Thing Is Monsters*](http://www.fantagraphics.com/my-favorite-thing-is-monsters/) (selected chapters) by Emil Ferris and [*Fun Home*](http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/booksellers/press_release/bechdel/) (selected chapters) by Alison Bechdel  
* Radio drama such as [*Sorry, Wrong Number*](https://archive.org/details/Suspense-SorryWrongNumber) by Lucile Fletcher and [*War of the Worlds*](https://archive.org/details/WarOfTheWorlds1938RadioBroadcast256kbps/War-of-the-Worlds-1938-Radio-Broadcast-136kbps-cleaned.mp3) by Orson Welles and H.G. Wells 
* Podcasts such as [*Everything Is Alive*](https://www.everythingisalive.com/episodes/maeve-lamppost-of-brooklyn) by Maeve Higgins, Ian Chillag, and Jennifer Mills and [*Within the Wires*](http://www.nightvalepresents.com/withinthewires) by Jeffrey Cranor, Janina Matthewson, and Mary Epworth
* Animated films such as [*Biidaaban (The Dawn Comes)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWjnYKyiUB8) by Amanda Strong and Leanne Betasamosake Simpson  
* Fantasy and science fiction such as [*The Fifth Season*](https://www.orbitbooks.net/orbit-excerpts/the-fifth-season/) (selected chapters) by N.K. Jemisin and ["Message in a Bottle"](https://tachyonpublications.com/product/falling-love-hominids/) by Nalo Hopkinson 
* Experimental fiction such as [*With Those We Love Alive*](http://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=with-those-we-love-alive) by Porpentine and Brenda Neotenomie and [*THE M00D OF THE MOMENT*](https://www.yhchang.com/THE_MOOD_OF_THE_MOMENT_V.html) by Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries

As we study these materials in class, you'll also make some media of your own. 

## What Will We Learn? 

You'll learn to: 

* Interpret the use of audio, image, and text, especially for storytelling. We'll practice various techniques for listening, watching, seeing, reading, and playing media. 
* Communicate with audio, image, and text. You'll have opportunities to practice with each of these media. 
* Make a simple website and some content for it. No worries if you've never made your own site. I'll provide you with examples and templates, and I will assume no experience in web design or content management. 

All three of these outcomes should, regardless of your major, apply to work across disciplines and occupations.  

## How Is the Course Structured? 

We'll meet twice each week. The course will combine lectures and class discussions with workshops. I will often dedicate an entire class session to a workshop, where you'll respond to prompts and worksheets I'll distribute. The prompts will guide your study and practice of media, including how you make your own content with audio, image, and text. 

## What Are the Assignments? 

I'm asking you to: 

* Keep a log / journal of your work, marked at the middle and end of term (each of these two marks will be 25% of your final grade) 
* Submit worksheets for four workshops (each 5% of your mark)
* Take an exam at the end of term (30% of your final mark)

There are no essays or presentations required for this course. 

## What Do I Need to Purchase? 

There are no required books or textbooks. I'll provide you with a course packet and also point you to some materials published online. I will recommend some games and books that can purchase if you wish.

## Who Are You? 

My name is Jentery Sayers. I'm an associate professor in the English department. I've been at UVic since 2011, and I did my PhD at the University of Washington. I teach media, fiction, and culture at UVic.
