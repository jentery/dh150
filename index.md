# Description 

Media are everywhere. This course examines how people compose fiction with them. How do we approach media and fiction together? How do we read but also watch, see, play, and listen to fiction? How is fiction designed and experienced? 

This course is not a technical course. It does not, for instance, involve any quantitative methods or computer programming. Please also note that, by "media," I mean "audio, image, and text," not "the media" or mass communications and their outlets. Since this is an introductory course open to all undergraduate students at UVic, I will not assume you have any experience with media or digital studies.  

# Aims

This course encourages you to: 

* Interpret the design and use of audio, image, and text for storytelling. We'll experiment with various techniques for watching, seeing, playing, reading, and listening to media and fiction.
* Communicate persuasively with audio, image, and text. You'll have opportunities to compose both with and about each of these media.
* Build a vocabulary for engaging media and fiction from the 20th and 21st centuries.  
* Make a simple website and some content for it. No worries if you've never made your own site. I’ll provide you with examples and templates, and I will assume no experience in web design or content management.

These four aims should apply to work across disciplines and occupations.

# Background

My name is Jentery Sayers. I’m an associate professor of English and Cultural, Social, and Political Thought (CSPT), and I direct the Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies. I've been at UVic since 2011, and I did my PhD at the University of Washington. Most of my work is in the field of comparative media studies. I teach courses on American fiction, cultural studies, media, and prototyping. 

This course has a history (since 2009 or so) of combining media concepts with media practice. The content is grounded in the humanities, but with questions relevant to the arts and sciences, too. I've taught this course numerous times, with a variety of themes. I like to anchor inquiry in how "this becomes that"&mdash;how, for instance, media are composed and then change over time&mdash;and I find the humanities to be central to matters of media and technology because they demonstrate why history, fiction, language, and culture are fundamental to not only innovation but also the values of design. How is stuff made, by whom, for whom, and under what assumptions? Engaging such questions demands attention to processes *and* things. Media aren't just products or ideas.   

# Structure

I've designed this course to unfold through a series of modules. I hope they provide you with a framework for what we'll study and a map for how we'll approach it.   

* "What Are Media?": on defining audio, image, text and their relation to fiction    
* "Making a Website": on using HTML and CSS to compose and publish audio, images, and text 
* "Media Aesthetics": on evaluating how we sense and make sense of media and fiction  
* "Audio in Fiction": on ways of listening to and playing fiction 
* "Images in Fiction": on ways of seeing, watching, and playing fiction 
* "Text in Fiction": on ways of reading and playing fiction 
* "Prototyping with Media and Fiction": on speculations informed by media aesthetics 
* "Remembering Media": on what we did and learned this term 

We'll meet twice each week. The course will combine lectures and class discussions with workshops. I will often dedicate an entire meeting to a workshop, where you'll respond to prompts and worksheets I'll distribute. The prompts will guide your study and practice of media, including how you make your own content with audio, image, and text.

# Assignments

I’m asking you to:

* Keep a [log](#prompts) of your work, marked at the middle and end of term (each of these two marks will be 25% of your final grade)
* Submit worksheets for four [workshops](#workshops) (each 5% of your mark)
* Take an exam at the end of term (30% of your final mark)

I will provide you with [prompts](#prompts) for each of these assignments. Except for the exam, which you'll submit to me in person, all of the assignments will be submitted online. You'll create a URL and website (public or private) for your log, and the worksheets will be online forms. The log will contain seven, eight, or nine entries (three or four submitted at the middle of term, and four or five more submitted at the end of term). Each entry should take approximately 60 to 90 minutes to compose, plus revisions to the log prior to submission. 

There are no essays or presentations required for this course.

# Notes 

As the term unfolds, I will share in this section notes and reflections from lectures and workshops. Expect new content here almost every week of class. These notes should help you to develop your log and prepare for the final exam.  

### Definitions

Here are some definitions of key terms used to engage media and fiction in this course. After "media" and "fiction," they are alphabetized.   
 
* **Fiction**: a work of audio, image, and/or text that imagines, if only in part, its character(s), world(s), and/or events(s); has a story that's arranged with narrative; may be read, watched, played, seen, and/or heard
* **Media**: congealed labour or techniques made durable; not "the media" (singular) or "mass media" of the communications industry; three primary examples in this course are audio, image, and text 
* **Apparatus**: a mechanism used to measure media and fiction and also economize people's experiences; examples in this course include editors, grids, engines, stacks, and networks 
* **Audio**: a congealed way of hearing and composing; at once process and thing                          
* **Format**: a way to nest, circulate, or store media; examples include novels, comics, games, and radio            
* **Genre**: when fiction congeals into recognizable conventions accompanied by audience expectations; may become someone's preferred way of engaging fiction; classic examples are tragedy or comedy, but other examples include fantasy, science fiction, detective, slapstick, romance, action, adventure, horror, mystery, simulation, role-playing, and suspense     
* **Image**: a congealed way of seeing and composing; at once process and thing
* **Labour**: what congeals in media but cannot be recorded completely by it; the activities people individually and collectively perform to produce work; examples include emotional, mental, physical, sensual, manual, and machine labour  
* **Narrative**: how the story in a work of fiction is structured and arranged; components include setup, focalization, character development, and the uses of narrators, flashbacks, and sequencing  
* **Norms**: worldviews that fiction and media both reproduce and resist; ideologies that discipline perception, the production of knowledge, and social and cultural practice; necessarily exclude some ways of hearing, seeing, reading, and composing in favour of other ways   
* **Play**: a negotiation or experiment with the meanings, materials, and modes of media and fiction; need not involve explicit rules; also the primary way of engaging games
* **Prototype**: a possibility presented through media and fiction; associated terms include sketch, scenario, wireframe, experiment, and draft; not a real or finished product with a brand; usually doesn't involve post-production   
* **Story**: the setting(s), plot, character(s), conflict(s), and point(s) of view in a work of fiction
* **Style**: what people say is unique about how a given person or group composes with audio, images, and/or text; an artist's or author's "signature"   
* **Technology**: a system, such as phonography, photography, print, and computing, that reproduces media; usually involves automation  
* **Text**: a congealed way of reading and composing; at once process and thing   
* **Work**: an output or result of labour, such as a work of fiction; not just an object or thing, but its content, apparatus, and the processes that went into making and circulating it 

Again, these definitions are not exhaustive. I provide them to render transparent the assumptions of this course and my approaches to it. Equally important, definitions are often quite fuzzy or contingent with history and culture. They are more like guides for situations than answers to important questions, and they should be approached with a healthy dose of skepticism. What's missing from them? What do people want from them? What makes them work? I thus hope you'll question and revise these definitions rather than adopting them wholesale for deployment in this course or elsewhere.

### Why Media?

What is the point of studying media and fiction together in the 2020s? Consider the following list. It translates how this course applies generally to the practice of communication and specifically to its analytical, structural, social, cultural, and practical dimensions. None of these applications is restricted to the academy. 

Approaching media and fiction together attends to matters of: 

* **Situation**, or the *context of communication*, including how, when, and where people relate and collaborate through particular media and/or fictions. 
* **Composition**, or the *content of communication*, including what people read, see, hear, watch, and play in particular media and/or fictions. 
* **Audience**, or the *purpose of communication*, including what people need, want, and/or expect from particular media and/or fictions. 
* **Norms**, or the *values of communication*, including what people deem to be credible, compelling, biased, predictable, or problematic about particular media and/or fictions. 
* **Novelty**, or the *uniqueness of communication*, including how and why particular media and/or fiction are considered to be innovative, disruptive, experimental, or generic. 
* **Engagement**, or the *experience of communication*, including what people feel and remember about particular media and/or fiction. 
* **Design**, or the *interface of communication*, including what people notice and ignore and how they navigate content and context. 

I use the acronym **SCANNED** to remember this list and to state succinctly why people might approach media and fiction together. I'll use the course modules to demonstrate how.

### Composing a Site

Here I'm going to explain how to keep a research log for this course using audio, image, and text. The log can be disseminated online as a website, but connecting to the internet isn't required to read or compose it. This module ("Making a Website") is the only technical part of the course. I promise!  

The log has eight components, all explained below. Composition happens in a text editor (1), conceptualization in a wireframe (2), encoding in HTML (3), media via referenced source files (4), presentation in CSS (5), distribution via FTP (6), publication via a URL (7), and validation via a . . . validator (8). Two formats are involved: HTML, which is the primary file format (`index.html`), and the log, which nests paragraphs of text organized into articles displayed on a page in reverse chronological order (newest content at the top), with a references section at the bottom.

**Text Editor** 

A text editor is not a word processor. It does not, for instance, present content as it may appear in print. Most computers come with a text editor already installed, but one can also be downloaded. I use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). When trying a text editor for the first time, I experiment with the settings. I paste some placeholder text (called "lorem ipsum") into the editor and then save it to my desktop as both a TXT and HTML file. (When naming files, I use camelCase, such as `myFile.html` or `mySong.mp3`, or snake_case, such as `my_file.html` or `my_song.mp3`, to avoid introducing spaces in filenames. Spaces create all sorts of problems.) I test colour schemes, too, and I check to see which dictionaries (such as Canadian English) are available. I also run a quick find and replace command to see how well that command functions in the editor, and I enable the "word wrap" feature if it's not already selected. (Word wrap ensures text appears within the width of the editor's window.) Once I'm done, I open other files, including HTML files, to see whether and how the editor highlights syntax (that is, how it displays text in different colours and fonts according to a given language's grammar and vocabulary). Syntax highlighting is very useful when writing in HTML. It highlights HTML tags, for example (see "HTML" below), allowing people to check for encoding errors and also scan a document to assess its structure. 

Text editors are designed according to lines, not pages. An entire paragraph of content will be only a line in an editor. Lines are also dedicated to spaces, such as spaces between paragraphs. I use a text editor to write essays and code, make websites and slides, and take notes. I composed this syllabus in a text editor, and with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) I converted the content into multiple formats so that people could access it via the web, e-readers, and print. One perceived benefit of writing with a text editor is that it can minimize distractions. Experiences vary, but I'm less likely to care about how many pages or words I've written, or the appearance and layout of my work, when using a text editor. There's less pressure; to me, text editors feel indifferent to circulation and publication. I also enjoy composing practically all my work in the same environment and would rather keep software subscriptions and dependencies to a minimum. Since text files are not large, they don't consume a bunch of space on my hard drive, either; nonetheless, I routinely back them up to a remote server, just in case something happens to my laptop.  

Text editors also foreground how and to what effects text are media. As explained in the following sections, composing HTML and CSS in an editor involves *toggling between text as content, presentation, annotation, structure, and rule*. Text serves more than one function. It helps to produce meaning, it describes, it shapes, it decorates, and it instructs. Yet some of those functions are not always obvious. A browser, for example, will initially display only the content and presentation of a document. People have to examine the document's source files to see some of the annotations, structures, and rules at play. Such examination evokes all the labour involved in making and maintaining the material people find online, including what's hidden from view. Despite all the rhetoric about digital this and digital that, the work of contemporary media isn't fast, easy, and automated, and a lot of it goes unacknowledged, unattributed, and uncompensated. 

**HTML** 

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a format and markup language used to present documents in browsers. It has a syntax made of tags. For keeping a research log, I made this [HTML document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jentery/dh150/master/html/index.html), which can be [viewed in a browser](https://jentery.github.io/dh150/html/) and is named `index.html`. (I explain the reason for the filename in the "URL" section below.) The document is quite simple, and it's only a page. My advice is to manually copy the [HTML document]((https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jentery/dh150/master/html/index.html), line by line (excluding entries 3-9), as a new file in a text editor. This way, HTML should be easier to recall as a process and not just a resource to copy and paste. This new file can also be named `index.html` (using `Save As...`). Clicking it should open it in a browser, where the source HTML can be viewed using a shortcut in Chrome (`Option+Command+U` on a Mac; `CTRL + U` on a PC), Firefox (`Command + U` on a Mac; `CTRL + U` on a PC), or Safari (`Option+Command+U` on a Mac).

An HTML document has a `<head>` and `<body>`. They're separate, but both are nested inside the `<html>` tag. The `<head>` section contains meta stuff, such as the content type, author name, page title, and language used. It can be seen in the source HTML; however, the `<head>` is not initially displayed in a browser. The `<body>`, meanwhile, is initially displayed in the browser and can be seen in the source HTML. It contains content, such as articles, headers, paragraphs, lists, images, audio, video, links, and footers. This content is annotated and structured with tags, which usually open with `< >` and close with `</ >` (an exception is an "empty tag," such as `<img>` and `<meta>`, because they do not describe content). Here is a list of useful tags for keeping a research log. All of them appear in the `index.html` file I provide.  

**Inside the Head**    
* `<head>`: contains the metadata of a page and its site; not the same as `<header>` 
* `<meta>` (empty tag): specific metadata about the site, such as the author name, language, and keywords
* `<title>`: the title of the page (this title appears in tabs and search engine results)
* `<link>` (empty tag): used to reference a stylesheet (see "CSS" below) 

**Inside the Body**   
* `<body>`: contains the content of the page 
* `<h1>, <h2>, <h3>`: section headings on the page; often used for titles of entries
* `<article>`: an article or entry on the page 
* `<header>`: a header of an article on the page; usually includes the article's title; not the same as `<head>`  
* `<aside>`: content, such as an "about me" section, indirectly related to the main content
* `<footer>`: content at the bottom of the page; usually includes basic information about the site or page 
* `<p>`: a paragraph 
* `<a>`: an anchor; used to create links to other sites or content elsewhere on the page or site; accompanied by `<href>`, which points to a URL (see "URL" below)
* `<code>`: a snippet of code 
* `<em>`: emphasized text; usually results in italics  
* `<strong>`: important text; usually results in bold 
* `<img>` (empty tag): an image file; requires pointing to a source file via `src` 
* `<audio>`: an audio file; requires pointing to a source file via `src`
* `<video>`: a video file; requires pointing to a source file via `src`

In the `index.html` file I provide, I use these tags to structure the log into a series of articles, producing the format of a research log. Each article contains content as well as a header, stylized like so: 

`<header>`   
`<h2>1: A Wireframe for My Research Log</h2>`    
`<h3>6 January 2020 by Jentery Sayers</h3>`   
`</header>`   

The title (`<h2>`) includes the number of the entry and a title for it. The metadata (`<h3>`) includes the date and author name. (I used my actual name here; however, authors obviously identify and attribute their work in multiple ways, which may not correspond partly or entirely with their actual names.) The article title and metadata are nested in a header (`<header>`), with the newest entry at the top of the page (reverse chronological order) and a references section at the bottom of the page. The content of each article is nested in paragraphs (`<p>`), and headers and paragraphs are nested in articles (`<article>`). Comments, which are often used for notes, explanations, and instructions as well as revisions and draft material, appear within `<!-- -->`. They are viewable only in the HTML source files. (Sometimes people forget they're there.)

The above snippet of `<header>` markup demonstrates HTML's use of *syntax*&mdash;a grammar or economy for giving a structure and vocabulary to text: using tags to arrange blocks of content into headings, for instance. But HTML also addresses *semantics* by defining the attributes of its elements: for example, `<p>` means, "This is a paragraph." Together, the syntax and semantics of HTML help people and machines to interpret the form of documents and their use of text as media. 

Today, HTML is frequently automated through WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) interfaces found in content management systems and word processors. People can simply highlight a word and convert it into a link, or they can run with an existing website theme instead of learning markup. But knowing how to compose with HTML isn't outdated; it's not some act of nostalgia for folks who won't let go of their text editors. It remains useful for several reasons. First, HTML is everywhere, and it's been around for a long time. HTML is now in version 5 (HTML5), and people across occupations rely on it to write. HTML is also a core component of web design. Familiarity with HTML increases confidence in not only the interpretation of online materials but also the creation of unique or experimental content. Third, management systems tend to give people way more than they need: databases, plugins, and themes, for example. While such systems may reduce learning curves, they usually increase labour over time. There's a reason they're called management systems: they require maintenance (such as updates), storage (usually on a remote server), other programs (called "dependencies"), and perhaps embedded advertisements. They may be susceptible to hacks, too, and getting all your stuff (media, content, and design files) out of a management system can be difficult. (I recommend avoiding software that doesn't let you export, or easily export, your stuff.) Conversely, a simple site, written locally on your computer, can be easier in the long run, with fewer storage and maintenance demands. (This research log, for example, should fit on a USB stick or phone.) Finally, the manual composition of HTML helps people to determine when they need, and don't need, to use particular software (including proprietary software), toolkits (like Bootstrap), and markup alternatives (such as Markdown, used by Reddit and GitHub). Making these decisions based on what's either necessary or preferred for a given project, as opposed to adopting high-performance platforms popular in industry or academia, is a form of "minimal computing": a low-tech, low-maintenance, content-forward approach to media practice.

**Wireframes**

Wireframes are low-tech design prototypes that present the basic form and layout of websites and apps. They are almost always drawn prior to content production, and they require only pencil and paper (I prefer graph paper, but a ruler and plain paper or a whiteboard and marker work, too). Here's a wireframe (COMING SOON) of the `index.html` file I provide above. The articles (`<article>`) are nested in a single section (`<section>`), and that section is sandwiched by the header (`<h1>`, top), bio (`<aside>`, bottom), and footer (`<footer>`, bottom). The articles are the main content, the header displays the title of the log, the bio describes the author, and the footer lists the author's name and affiliation as well as the applicable license. All these tags are nested inside the body (`<body>`), and metadata (found within `<head>`) is not shown. Note that, since the log is only a page, there's no navigation bar or search box. Also note *how the page is an image*: a congealed way of seeing the research log without the particulars of content or markup. Creating and tweaking wireframes early in the composition process can save people a lot of time, labour, and resources, and many people find such low-tech, abstract representations to be quite useful when determining and testing how audiences may find, navigate, engage, and remember content. 

**Media**  

The `img`, `audio`, and `video` tags are used to display media in HTML documents. I'll start with images. 

`<img src="wireframe.jpg" alt="A wireframe of my research log. It's drawn with pencil and contains a title at the top, four articles in the middle, and an aside and footer at the bottom. All are nested inside the body of the log. The frames contain no content or markup. The wireframe only presents the log's general shape and structure.">`

This `img` tag with `src=` is used to point to a JPEG file inside the same folder as `index.html` (see "HTML" above), and `alt=` is used to describe the image as text. This alternative text helps people using screen readers to hear and interpret the image content. Search engines also read alt text, which shapes search results. Common image formats are JPEG, GIF, TIFF, and PNG. For this research log, image widths of 400-800 pixels are probably best. Images can be resized in Microsoft Paint (PC) and Preview (Mac) and transfered to a server with FTP (see "FTP" below). Screengrabs can be taken with a Snipping Tool (PC) and the shortcut, `Shift-Command-4` (Mac). If image files are placed in a subdirectory such as `images`, then the `img src=` file path should point to that subdirectory: `<img src="images/wireframe.jpg">` instead of `<img src="wireframe.jpg">`, for example. References to source files won't work if the path isn't placed inside quotation marks (`" "`). 

Audio and video are a bit different, in part because they require controls (a "player").

`<audio controls>`    
`<source src="wireframe.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">`    
`<source src="wireframe.ogg" type="audio/ogg">`    
`Your browser doesn't support HTML5 audio.`    
`</audio>`    

`<video controls width="450">`    
`<source src="wireframe.mp4" type="video/mp4">`   
`<source src="wireframe.webm" type="video/webm">`    
`Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.`    
`</video>`     

Again, the `src=` points to a file within the same folder as `index.html`, but the types are defined (`mp3` or `ogg` for audio; `mp4` or `webm` for video), and at least two formats are provided for each (to render the audio and video more accessible across browsers with different supported formats). `Your browser doesn't support...` is included in case the browser can't display audio or video in HTML5. Common audio formats are MP3, Ogg, and WAV, and MP3 should work across all browsers at this point. Common video formats are MP4, Ogg, and WebM, and MP4 should work across all browsers, too. When embedding video, the frame width needs to be defined; in the example above, the width is 450 pixels. Audio and video can be created on many mobile phones and then sent to laptops and desktops. They can also be transfered to a server with FTP (see "FTP" below). Audacity is a popular, cross-platform audio editor; iMovie is provided for video on Macs; and the Photos app on PCs can be used to edit video. The Adobe Creative suite remains an industry standard for both audio and video as well as design. If audio and video files are placed in a subdirectory such as `assets` or `media`, then the `source src=` file path should point to that subdirectory: `<source src="media/wireframe.mp3">` instead of `<source src="wireframe.mp3">`, for example. People often place all their media (images, audio, and video) in one folder, if only to make them easier to find. And again, references to source files won't work if the path isn't placed inside quotation marks (`" "`). 

One final note: image, audio, and video do not need to be embedded in an HTML document. Links are an alternative, and they can also supplement embedded media: `<a href="wireframe.mp3">description of my wireframe</a>`, `<a href="wireframe.mp4">video of my wireframe</a>`, or `<a href="wireframe.jpg">photo of my wireframe</a>`, for example. A link sends people to another page (in this case, one dedicated to an image, audio clip, or video clip), and it also provides them with the address (see "URL" below) of source files. That address is used to download (`Save As...`) media. 

**CSS**

While HTML is a markup language, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language. HTML emphasizes structure and semantics; it organizes content and annotates it. CSS emphasizes structure and rules; it describes the presentation of markup such as HTML. Both involve a syntax. But, in short, presentation and its structure (CSS, in `style.css`) are separated from content and its structure (HTML, in `index.html`), and together they are rendered as a page in a browser. As with HTML, I made an example [CSS file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jentery/dh150/master/html/style.css) to use for a research log. It's also quite basic, intended only to give people a sense of how CSS works. My advice is to manually copy it, line by line, in a text editor. This new file can also be named `style.css` (using `Save As...`), which is the CSS filename conventionally used in web design.  

CSS is the file pertaining to layout, fonts, colour, and decoration. It contains a list of rules. A rule (also called a rule set) requires a "selector" and "declaration block," and that declaration block consists of properties and values. Consider, for instance, a few lines near the top of the `style.css` file referenced above: 

`body {`      
`font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;`    
`background-color: #ffffff;`    
`}`

The selector is `body`, the declaration block includes two declarations made within braces (`{ }`), the properties in the declaration are `font-family` and `background-color`, and the values of the properties are `Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif` and `#ffffff`. If I translate this rule set into sentences, it says: "The body text, including headings and paragraphs, should be displayed in Helvetica, with a background colour of white. If Helvetica is not installed, the text should display in Arial. If Arial is not installed, the text should display in the default sans-serif font." Note that CSS uses American English ("color"), hexidecimal values (a hash followed by six alphanumeric characters, such as `#ffffff` for white), hyphens between words in properties, colons to separate properties from values, and semicolons to define the end of a declaration. I recommend using no more than two fonts on a page and establishing contrast between the foreground (text colour) and background (background color). Hexidecimal colour codes and pickers are available online, Google maintains a large [collection of fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), and Utah State University's WebAim project provides tools, such as the [contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/), for accessibility. 

In this case, the style sheet I provide does not contain very many rule sets. What is not defined (such as font size and colour) will be defined by the system and/or browser's default settings. I'm keeping the style simple to focus the log on content and to decrease page load time. That said, there's a plenty of room for the sheet to grow. For now, here's a list of the selectors appearing in the `style.css` file I provide. 

* `body`: describes the presentation of content within the HTML `<body>` tag 
* `article`: describes the presentation of content within the HTML `<article>` tag
* `aside`: describes the presentation of content within the HTML `<aside>` tag
* `footer`: describes the presentation of content within the HTML `<footer>` tag
* `a`: describes the presentation of anchor (`<a>`) tags, including `a:link` (an unvisited link), `a:visited` (a visited link), `a:hover` (mouse-over effect), and `a:active` (clicked or selected link), which should be listed in that order in the `style.css` file 

One perhaps unfamiliar property in `style.css` is `padding`. It creates space around an HTML element defined by a tag such as `<aside>`. If the element has a border, then `padding` is the space between the content and its border. 

Of course, `style.css` needs to "talk" to `index.html`. This connection is made via a reference already included in the `<head>` of the `index.html` file I reference above: 

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`

Style sheets for websites can usually be found by adding `style.css` after the `/` at the end of a URL (see "URL" below), and they more or less operate in the background. Sometimes they are embedded in HTML files, but I recommend creating a separate CSS file, especially when building large sites. A single change to a CSS file can apply to an entire website. I also prefer to toggle between reading CSS and HTML instead of interpreting them in the same space.  

CSS is interesting because, although it helps to create the page content and presentation people see on screens (or hear with screen readers), it's initially hidden from view and interpreted mostly by machines. Again, CSS is a set of declarations written with text: a language made for rendering optical images with pixels. Even if it does run in the background, learning to compose with it facilitates important distinctions between making meaning and making rules with text. Both are constructed and interpreted; however, *rules are to be enacted while meaning is to be deciphered.*

### Publishing a Site 

I described the first five components of a research log in "Composing a Site." Here I'll describe the other three components.  

**FTP**

People use File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to move files between "clients" (such as laptops, mobile phones, programs, and desktop computers) and servers on a network. FTP is a way to backup files; it's also a mechanism for dissemination and publication. I can, for example, open an FTP application, log into my host server, and transfer my `index.html` file (see "HTML" above) by dragging and dropping it from my desktop into the FTP application. Depending on the server settings and where exactly I drop the file, `index.html` may be discoverable online. 

As an example, students at the University of Victoria (UVic) may use FTP and UVic's hosting services to publish web content. Systems provides [instructions](https://www.uvic.ca/systems/support/web/webhosting-students/index.php) for the entire process (only five steps!), and they recommend a Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) application called Cyberduck. To connect and transfer files to `studentweb.uvic.ca` (the host server), you need a secure internet connection to the UVic network either on campus or via a [Virtual Private Network (VPN)](https://www.uvic.ca/systems/support/internettelephone/remoteaccess/index.php) when not on campus. You can also restrict access to your site using [Windows](https://www.uvic.ca/systems/support/web/webhosting-students/restrictwindows.php) or [Mac OS](https://www.uvic.ca/systems/support/web/webhosting-students/restrictmacos.php). Files placed in the `www` folder of `student.uvic.ca` will be found at `https://studentweb.uvic.ca/~NetLinkID`, where `NetLinkID` is the student's NetLink ID (for example, my NetLinkID is `jentery`, and thus my student URL would be `https://studentweb.uvic.ca/~jentery`). It's easy to forget, but the `~` before the NetLink ID in the URL is required. Student web content will not appear without it.   

FTP applications rely on Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to facilitate transfer. This way, people can use input fields, icons, windows, buttons, and lists instead of writing text commands in a computer terminal. Images accompany text in a GUI to render the transfer process more approachable, and an FTP connection to a host server may in some cases decrease or eliminate the need for content management and/or file sharing systems. Again, experiences vary. 

Please note that the URL convention for this course is: `https://studentweb.uvic.ca/~NetLinkID/dh150/`. Just replace `NetLinkID` with your UVic Netlink ID. Thank you! 

**URL**  

A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a reference to a resource on the web. The most common type of URL refers to a webpage via Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). URLs are found in address bars of browsers and are also called web addresses. At the University of Victoria (UVic), an example is `https://studentweb.uvic.ca/~NetLinkID/index.html`. The protocol is HTTP (secured, hence the `s` in `https`), the host is `studentweb.uvic.ca`, the subdirectory is `~NetLinkID` (such as `~jentery`), and the filename is `index.html`. When `https://studentweb.uvic.ca/~NetLinkID/` is entered in an address bar, the browser will look for the server's default document. In this case (and in most), that default document is `index.html`, meaning people can just type `https://studentweb.uvic.ca/~NetLinkID/` (without the filename) to load the site. For this reason, `index` is the filename most often used for website homepages, and it's the filename used for the research log in this course.  

Again, please note that the URL convention for this course is: `https://studentweb.uvic.ca/~NetLinkID/dh150/`. Just replace `NetLinkID` with your UVic Netlink ID. Thank you! 

**Validator**

The syntax of CSS and HTML&mdash;their grammar, vocabulary, and resulting structure&mdash;can be validated by a computer. Validation attends to not only functionality, such as the economical uses of tags and selectors, but also accessibility, including engagement with media by people with disabilities and impairments. The [W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) observes that "accessibility is essential for some and useful for all," and they provide validation services for [markup](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). Material can be validated via upload, URL, or direct input. While valid syntax is but one step toward accessibility, it's an important and informative one, especially when considered early and often. I try to validate a research log whenever I publish new entries.

### Prompts 

Here are the prompts and rubric for your log this term. Note that the log is marked twice (middle and end of term), and each mark is 25% of your final grade. By the term's end, the log should contain seven, eight, or nine entries. Please review the rubric to determine how many entries you'd like to complete.     

Responses to these prompts should take approximately 60 to 90 minutes to compose (excluding time spent studying the assigned materials), plus time spent revising the log prior to submission. 

**First Half of Your Log** 

Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries made an animated piece titled, *M00D OF THE MOMENT*. Please use 250-300 words and at least one example from the piece to not only describe its mood but also explain whether and under what assumptions you consider it to be immersive.  

Marina Kittaka's *Secrets Agents* is a puzzle adventure game with voice-over. Compose 30 seconds to 1 minute of additional voice-over for the game and use 50-75 words to describe your intent for it. Please also indicate when in the game the voice-over would play or what action would trigger it. Include the audio file in your entry.

Nalo Hopkinson's piece, "Message in a Bottle," is a short story partly about curation. Please use 250-300 words and at least one example from the story to explain why, with some attention to the function of "messengers" in the narrative.  

Orson Welles's *War of the Worlds* uses sound effects and acousmatic voices to combine science fiction with *radio vérité*. Please use 250-300 words and at least one example from the radio drama to explain how it not only achieves this combination but also massages or manipulates the listening process.  

Episode one of *Within the Wire*'s first season uses an audio cassette and a full body relaxation course to mediate its relation with listeners. Please use 250-300 words and at least one example from the episode to describe how and to what effects on the story's style. 

*Everything Is Alive* is a podcast where inanimate objects speak and participate in interviews. Review the titles of all 21 episodes and then compose 1 to 2 minutes of your own. Please follow the podcast's conventions: give your episode a title as well as a one- or two-sentence description. Include the audio file in your entry and avoid re-using objects or names from previous episodes.  

Lucille Fletcher's *Sorry, Wrong Number* demonstrates that the telephone network is anything but immediate. Please use 250-300 words and at least one example from the radio drama to explain how, by whom, and to what effects Mrs. Stevenson's conversations are mediated. 

I provided you with a style template for your log. Change it to improve how your log is read and navigated and then use 200-250 words plus examples from your `style.css` file to explain the changes, why you made them, and how they improved the log's design. 

Imagine you've been asked to teach Grade 12 students about the use of audio in fiction. Please identify one (and only one) key concept you'd teach and then compose a 2- to 3-minute audio file that not only explains the concept but also conveys or performs its significance to Grade 12 students. In your audio, please draw example(s) from at least one work of fiction we studied.  

Use the style and content of the above prompts to write your own and respond to it. Please email a draft of your prompt to me by Monday, February 10th for review and approval.

### The 20 M's

"Media aesthetics" is the framework we'll use to approach media and fiction in this course. I define it as *the practice of evaluating how design and content are apprehended, comprehended, synthesized, and reproduced*. These terms are defined below. 

We'll use 20 words starting with the letter "m" to facilitate our study of media and fiction through media aesthetics. The list is a guide, not a set of instructions, and will inevitably fall apart with some practice and pressure. In the list I avoid common dichotomies between mind and body, logic and feeling, and analysis and experience, mostly because such dichotomies are driven by norms or ideals frequently critiqued within media and literary studies. Although there's an order to the outline, with "Apprehension" appearing first, it's not a hierarchy or series of steps. The "Evaluation" section may prompt revisions to "Synthesis," for example, or some people may wish to start with "Comprehension." I use "work" throughout the guide to refer to a work of fiction and its media (audio, image, and text), and I encourage repeated description to render the process as approachable as possible. Suggestions welcome.  

**Apprehension** 

"What's happening here?" Apprehension is about impressions, sensations, and evocations. It's about the moment, which may be familiar. "I've felt this before." While experience may feel personal, it's social, too. It's structured by media and fiction, and it's shaped by design.   

* Describe the [*materials*](#material) used. 
* Describe the [*modes*](#modes) or senses engaged. 
* Describe the [*mood*](#mood) inhabited or experienced. 

Consider recording or annotating your (initial) engagement in real time (like an unboxing video or Let's Play), if only for your own records. With express consent, you might do the same for someone else and then compare your results. Account for eye rolls and anxious feelings as well: what's off-putting, predictable, unclear, discomfiting, frustrating . . . Apprehension isn't necessarily appreciation.   

**Comprehension** 

"What's this about?" Comprehension is about expressions, understanding, and situating things. It's about making sense after the fact&mdash;identifying and arranging the parts. While it may feel impersonal, it's nevertheless motivated. People usually want meaning and even purpose from media and fiction. 

* Describe the [*modules*](#modules) or parts of the work. 
* Describe the units used to [*measure*](#measure) the work and its parts.  
* Describe the [*main content*](#main-content) of the story (who, what, when, and where).
* Describe the work's history, its network, and its [*moment*](#moment) of composition (who, what, when, and where). 

Consider distilling the work, reflecting on it, and even graphing its parts, story, and/or relation to other works in its network. Note how and when these practices are about control, or the pleasure of making sense of things. When is control problematic? What do graphs or classifications get wrong? 

**Synthesis** 

"How does it all come together?" Synthesis is about boundaries and relations. It entwines apprehension with comprehension. It connects materials with abstractions and personal experiences with structures and designs. It's never total or complete; it can't and shouldn't account for all the things.  

* Describe how (you assume) the work was [*made*](#made). 
* Get [*meta*](#meta). Describe how the story is told.
* Describe what the work [*means*](#means) (or its multiple, incongruous *meanings*). 
* Describe how it [*massages*](#massage) or [*manipulates*](#massage) people's senses.
* Describe how people *move* with, within, across, and beyond it. 
* Describe what [*motivates*](#motivates) people to return to and/or identify with it. 
* Describe how it and responses to it have *morphed* over time. 
* Describe how it is or would be collected and *maintained* over time. 

Consider taking notes for each of these but developing a response to just one or two. Otherwise, the process may be overwhelming. 

**Evaluation** 

"So what?" Evaluation is about assessment, or why people should care about the work and engagements with it. Evaluations have intended audiences; knowing that audience and their expectations focuses the inquiry. 

* Describe how the work *mediates* its relation to power and "common sense" (norms, assumed knowledge, and congealed ways of perceiving). 
* Describe who and what it *misses*, ignores, or essentializes.  
* Describe the *memories* it elicits and how it elicits them. 
* Describe how it functions as *mimesis* (show, drama) and diegesis (tell, narrative) within and against its network.  

Again, consider taking notes for each of these but developing a response to just one or two. A response may not be an essay or series of paragraphs. Compose with audio, image, and/or text to determine what sticks with you and/or what others deem to be most compelling.  

**Action** 

"What to do about it all?" Action is about learning and intervention: what people do with a work of media and fiction they encounter and study. Perhaps they do nothing with it. Preferring not to is indeed a sort of action. But so are improving the work, responding to it, integrating it into a project, discussing it with others, and drawing motivation from it. "Active learning" assumes many forms.  

* *Mobilize* the work: change it, prototype with it, teach it, critique it, exhibit it, write about it. 

Consider how a given work of media and fiction intersects with your own interests and trajectories and then determine how to communicate these intersections to (or with) other people.

### Apparatuses

Approaches to media in fiction rely heavily on how media are measured: how they are divided into components and then isolated, traversed, compared, contrasted, and the like. These components are not the inevitable output of technologies. They are decisions with histories, norms, and expectations. That is, they are made and used often, they have conventions, and people want or assume particular experiences from them. They are also entwined with disciplines and discourses, such as how people talk about games, comics, radio, and books. A mechanism for the production of these components may be called an "apparatus."

An apparatus is not exactly a form or template. It's a relation machine. It helps people to sense and make sense of media in fiction&mdash;to measure media, build vocabularies for media, and move between, within, across, beyond, and to media.

Here's a list of five apparatuses at play in this course. After each, I mention some components they produce and some relations they enable. I imagine a few of the terms may be unfamiliar, but I define the terms in later modules, such as "Audio in Fiction," "Images in Fiction," and "Text in Fiction." Thanks for your patience.   

* **The Grid**: produces panels and gutters in comics; columns, margins, headers, and lexia on pages; and snap guides in design software; relations premised on flatness, surface, sequence, syntax, scanning, and juxtaposition
* **The Stack**: produces a front end and back end as well as presentation, logic, and database layers; relations premised on depth, dependencies, access, and visibility 
* **The Network**: produces paths, maps, branches, and nodes; relations premised on links, forks, paradigms, and wandering 
* **The Editor**: produces tracks, segments, fades, cuts, splices, wipes, and effects; relations premised on ellipsis, sequence, condensing, synchronization, and simultaneity 
* **The Engine**: produces worlds, theatres, and models; relations premised on programming, simulation, immersion, and immediacy  

These apparatuses of course intersect. Any given web project, for instance, may involve all of them. Equally interesting, an apparatus may not be explicit in people's engagements with media. The lines of a grid or the graphs for a network rarely appear on page or screen, and an engine usually wants people to forget they're inside a program or world. An apparatus is thus more like an interface. It's there, with palpable consequences; it's just not tangible or tactile.   

An apparatus has clear implications for design, yet it's relevant to studies of fiction, too. If an apparatus is a relation machine, then those relations likely congeal with repeated and collocated use, understood in fiction as genre. Here's another list, then. It uses prepositions to mark relations enabled by apparatuses and then experiments with those prepositions to describe components and experiences common in particular genres, which I italicize. 

* **At (spectacle)**: privileges the coherence of audio, image, and/or text into a single presentation; the story matters less than the experience; spectacles are common in *action and adventure*   
* **Within (worldbuilding)**: privileges the configuration of audio, image, and/or text as components in a system with rules or conventions; a story is played or inhabited; worldbuilding is common in *fantasy, science fiction, and roleplaying*        
* **Between (texture)**: privileges friction or tension between components of audio, image, and/or text; a story emerges from play or ambiguity and may promise resolution; texture is common in *strategy, comedy, and detective fiction*   
* **Across (deferral)**: privileges the use of audio, image, and/or text to make promises and then postpone delivery; the story thrives on what is or could be next; deferral is common in *mystery, horror, thrillers, and suspense*   
* **Beyond (epic)**: privileges pointing to audio, image, and/or text found elsewhere; the story is part of and refers to something larger; epic is common in *sagas, encyclopedic fiction, and historical fiction* 
* **To (address)**: privileges interpellation (hey you!) or identification (it me!) via components of audio, image, and/or text; address is common in *simulation and coming-of-age fiction*    

These aren't recipes for genres, and this isn't an exercise in totalization (as if one list could capture everything about genre). It's simply a starting point for approaching media in fiction through an apparatus. I return to the notion of genre later in this course. For now, I'll repeat here my definition of it: "genre: when fiction congeals into recognizable conventions accompanied by audience expectations; may become someone's preferred way of engaging fiction." The apparatus of media, or how they're measured, shapes these conventions and expectations.

### Workshops 

I'm asking you to complete four worksheets for four workshops this term. There will be a total of eight workshops, which you'll complete with a partner, with one of you completing a worksheet per workshop. The worksheets will be circulated as forms for you to submit online. Here's the rubric for the worksheets, each 5% of your final mark. Worksheets should be submitted before the next class meeting begins. Please do not submit more than one worksheet per workshop. 

A+: The content of the worksheet is clear and contains no typos or other such hiccups. It responds accurately to the questions asked. It not only addresses what was taught and discussed during the workshop but adds an original and compelling perspective that wasn't taught or discussed. The worksheet was submitted on time. 

A: The content of the worksheet is clear and contains no typos or other such hiccups. It responds accurately to the questions asked. It not only addresses what was taught and discussed during the workshop but adds an insightful and compelling perspective that wasn't taught or discussed. The worksheet was submitted on time. 

A-: The content of the worksheet is clear and contains few to no typos or other such hiccups. It responds accurately to the questions asked. It not only addresses what was taught and discussed during the workshop but attends to details that weren't addressed or discussed. The worksheet was submitted on time. 

B or B+: The content of the worksheet is mostly clear and contains few typos or other such hiccups. It responds accurately to the questions asked. It addresses what was taught and discussed during the workshop. The worksheet was submitted on time.

### Material

As part of "apprehension" in [the 20 M's](#the-20-ms), I encourage you to consider the materials used in the work of fiction. Materials are about the work as matter and physical substance. Here are some ways to think about materials:  

* Presence: can you touch or handle it? 
* Texture: is it smooth or rough? 
* Emphemera: what about it disappears, or what's ghostly or mutable about it? 
* Visibility: what materials can you see? not see?  
* Audibility: does it make a sound? what materials can you hear?
* Packaging: is it packaged? if so, describe the packaging. 
* Recording: how is it recorded? can you handle or see the record? 

Materials prompt considerations of the work as *stuff*. 

---

### Modes

As part of "apprehension" in [the 20 M's](#the-20-ms), I encourage you to consider the modes or senses engaged. Modes and senses are about how people's bodies are engaged or addressed by fiction. Here are some ways to think about modes and senses:  

* Through the five senses (hearing, seeing, tasting, smelling, and touching), including which are engaged more than others by the work(s) of fiction at hand.  
* WOVEN: writing (including reading), oral (what's said and heard), visual (colour, layout, and images, for instance), electronic (how the work transmits media, and whether it's electronic), and nonverbal (gesture, audio, and movement, for instance). Thanks to [Georgia Tech's Writing and Communication Program](https://wcprogram.lmc.gatech.edu/posters/woven) for this approach and the acronym, WOVEN. 
* Agency: are you moving / engaging with or against the work? Maybe somewhere in between? What's the flow? Are you in, or do you want to be in, control? 

Modes and senses prompt considerations of *attention and how we attend*.  

---

### Mood

As part of "apprehension" in [the 20 M's](#the-20-ms), I encourage you to consider the mood. The mood is about being in the world and engaging fiction. What's the work's vibe or feel? Here are some ways to think about mood: 

* Describe the work as an encounter. What or whom are you encountering? Does it feel close or distant? 
* Describe the work as an atmosphere. What's the "weather" of the work? 
* Describe the work's tone. Is it serious? Playful? Vauge? Direct? 
* Describe the work as a feeling. Any goosebumps? What emotions or experiences do you associate with it? 

Mood prompts considerations of *distance, immediacy, or familiarity.* 

---

### Modules

As part of "comprehension" in [the 20 M's](#the-20-ms), I encourage you to consider modules, which draw attention the work's design and structure. Here are some ways to think about modules: 

* Is the work available as a collection of component parts or files? If so, describe them. (Consider a website, for instance. It may have HTML, CSS, and media files.)
* Describe the components of the work's composition, even if they are not available as a collection of parts or files. (Consider radio drama or podcasts, for instance. Their components may include dialogue (DX), sound effects (SFX), background sound (BG), and music (MX). Or, consider comics. Their components may include panels, gutters, tiers, and speech bubbles.) 

Modules prompt considerations of the *relationships between parts and whole*. 

---

### Measure 

As part of "comprehension" in [the 20 M's](#the-20-ms), I encourage you to consider measurements. To measure is to assess and/or quantify media, fiction, and engagements with them. Here are some ways to think about measurements:  

* Length: the work as pages, words, or minutes, e.g.  
* Progress: the work as levels or the distance to the end, e.g.
* Success: the work as points or a collection, e.g.
* Body/Content: the work as chapters, worlds, scenarios, or episodes, e.g. 
* Presentation: the work as its screen (size), resolution, compression, or fidelity, e.g.  
* Attention: the work as clicks, views, sales, or ratings, e.g. 

Measurements prompt considerations of *value*. 

---

### Main Content 

As part of "comprehension" in [the 20 M's](#the-20-ms), I encourage you to consider the main content or story. Here are some ways to think about it: 

* Characters: humans, robots, nonhuman animals, mythological, and even environments or parts of the environment  
* Setting: time, place, and location of the story 
* Plot: major events and what happens, typically understood through exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and denouement / resolution   
* Theme: core ideas, threads, and even morals / lessons
* Conflict: between characters, events, groups, environments (the tension upon which the story relies) 
* Point of view: first, second, or third-person (omniscient or limited)

The main content prompts considerations of *shared interpretation*, or what about a story puts people on the same page. 

---

### Moment

As part of "comprehension" in [the 20 M's](#the-20-ms), I encourage you to consider the moment(s) of the work's composition, circulation, and reception. The moment is about context. Here are some ways to think about a moment: 

* Identify who was involved in the work. Consider who got credit and for what. 
* Identify when it was made and circulated. Consider what other kinds of work were popular at that time. 
* Describe what was happening when it was made and circulated. Consider important historical, cultural, and artistic events as well as what the authors / artists were doing at (or around) the time. 
* Describe where the work was made and circulated. Consider its network, geographic location, and "scene." In some cases, the network may be quite literal: a radio or tv network, for instance. 
* Describe its reception over time. Compare its reception now with its reception then. 

The moment prompts considerations of *shared situations*, or what about a work puts people in the same space and/or time. 

---

### Meta

As part of "synthesis" in [the 20 M's](#the-20-ms), I encourage you to get meta about how the story is told. Here are some ways to get meta. Consider the:  

* Situation: What's known or taken for granted in the work? How do characters understand each other (or so we assume)?
* World: What's the scope and scale of the setting and its systems, history, mythologies, and/or landscape? How is the world of the work bigger or more expansive than the story itself? 
* Duration: How long does the story take to communicate certain things? How does it use abbreviation, summary, stretched time, or warped time? What moves quickly? What doesn't? 
* Frequency: What's repeated? What are the patterns or textures of the work? 
* Sequencing: How is the work arranged chronologically (analepsis, prolepsis) and non-chronologically? How does it use leveling (progressive disclosure)? Or branching (map or tree)?  
* Evocation: How does the work draw on memories and resemblances?  
* Focalization: How do we get our knowledge from characters and/or narrators (zero = omniscient narrator who knows more than characters, internal = narrator is a character and thus knows what the character knows, and external focalization = narator or camera eye telling less than what characters know)?
* Narration (compare with plot above): How is the story told? Often involves abstract (summary), orientation (time and place), complicating action, resolution (climax), evaluation (commentary or elucidation), and coda (time of story meets time of narrative).

The meta stuff prompts considerations of *design, style, and structure*. 

---

### Massage

As part of "synthesis" in [the 20 M's](#the-20-ms), I encourage you to consider how the work massages or manipulates the senses. Here are some ways to think about massage and manipulation:  

* Is the work securing consensus? If so, then how? And what sort of consensus? 
* Is the work a distraction? If so, then how? And from what? 
* Is the work immersive? If so, then how? And in what?  
* Does the work involve interaction? Does it invite input? Or maybe dialogue? If so, then how does it change, if at all, with each interaction? 
* Does the work have a rhythm? If so, then what is it? And how does it affect flow?  
* Does the work involve simultaneity? Does it ask you to balance things or to mulitask? If so, then to what effects? 
* Does the work address you (hey you! hi there)? If so, then how? Directly or indirectly? Under what assumptions?       

Massaging and manipulation prompt considerations of *motivation and ideology*.

# Policies 

Here are policies for the course. I'll review each of them during our first meeting, but please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions or concerns about them. 

### Prerequisites 

There are no prerequisites for this course. It is open to all undergraduate students at UVic. 
  
### Assessment 

The final exam and one half of your log are required to pass this course. Failure to complete these two assignments will result in a failing N grade (calculated as a 0 for your GPA). 

I will use UVic's [undergraduate grading scale](https://web.uvic.ca/calendar2020-01/undergrad/info/regulations/grading.html) to produce rubrics for each assignment in this course and assess your work. I do not post marks outside my office, and I do not use plagiarism detection software.

### Late Submissions and Extensions

If you need to request an extension or you're concerned about the possibility of a late submission, then please email me. I recommend that you do not fall behind on any assignment, if possible, but I understand that extensions may be necessary for numerous reasons. 

### Communications 

The best way to communicate with me is in person, either by appointment or during my office hours, which are Mondays, 1-3pm, in CLE D334. You are also welcome to email me at jentery@uvic.ca. I respond to work email between 9am and 5pm, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.  

You are also welcome to communicate with Yu-Hsuan, Faith, and Ian in person or by email or appointment. TAs for this course are able to provide guidance on your work, but please see me with any questions about your marks and how assignments are assessed. 

### Feedback 

Yu-Hsuan, Faith, Ian, and I will provide feedback on your logs. We'll do so in writing, and feedback will be distributed in person during class. I will provide feedback in person (by appointment) on your exam. 

Throughout the term, I'll request feedback (verbal and in writing) from you on how the course is going. I'll also ask you to complete Course Experience Surveys at the end of the term (during our last meeting). 

### Attendance and Participation

Weekly attendance in undergraduate courses is expected. If you must miss class, then please notify me ahead of time by email. Cases of continuous, unexplained absence may negatively affect your grade, log, exam, and performance in workshops. Attendance and active participation in discussions and workshops are part of fulfilling the course requirements. 

### Laptops and Mobile Devices 

Laptops and mobile devices are welcome in (but not required for) this course. 

### Learning Climate  

The University of Victoria is committed to promoting, providing, and protecting a positive, supportive, and safe working and learning environment for all its members. You and I are expected to adhere to [UVic's equity and human rights policies](https://www.uvic.ca/equity/). You should alert me immediately if you have any questions about these policies and their application, or if you have concerns about course proceedings or participants.

### Academic Integrity  

You and I are expected to adhere to [UVic's academic integrity policy](https://www.uvic.ca/current-students/home/academics/academic-integrity/index.php) and be aware of the policies for the evaluation of student course work. Violations of the integrity policy will result in a failing grade for the given assignment and may additionally result in a failing grade for the course. By taking this course, you agree that all submitted assignments may be subject to an originality review. I do not use software to detect plagiarism in essays or any other assignments.

### Accessibility and Accommodation 

Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. In particular, if you have a disability or health consideration that may require accommodations, please feel free to approach me and/or the [Centre for Accessible Learning (CAL)](https://www.uvic.ca/services/cal/) as soon as possible. CAL staff are available by appointment to assess specific needs, provide referrals, and arrange appropriate accommodations. The sooner you let us know your needs, the quicker we can assist you in achieving your learning goals in this course.

### Basic Needs 

I want you to thrive in this course and everywhere else. Please let me know as early as possible if you have any concerns or if you require any assistance to succeed. I’ll do my best to help.

If you need to cover gaps in care, then please don't hesitate to bring your children to class. Babies who are nursing are always welcome, as I do not want you to choose between feeding your child and continuing your education. 

UVic takes student mental health very seriously, with a [website](https://www.uvic.ca/mentalhealth/) full of resources. We offer services such as assistance and referral to address students' personal, social, career, and study skills concerns. Services for students also include crisis and emergency mental health consultation and confidential assessment, counselling services (individual and small group), and referrals. Many of these programs are connected with Health Services, which is located at the Petersen Health Centre (Lower Parking Lot #5, off Sinclair Road, behind the residence cafeteria). Many offices have walk-in hours as well as appointments. 

The [Student Services website](https://www.uvic.ca/studentaffairs/departments/student-services/index.php) lists several policies that you might want to know about and may make your life at UVic safer and easier. Only some of them are directly related to this course, but they're still important.
