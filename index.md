# Description 

Aside from a module on making a website, this is not a technical course. The assignments are open to media practice (such as the composition of audio and video) without requiring it. The course does not involve any quantitative or computational methods, either. Please also note that, by "media," I mean "audio, image, and text," not "the media" or mass communications and their outlets. 

# Aims

This course encourages you to practice: 

* Interpreting the design and use of audio, image, and text for storytelling. We'll experiment with various techniques for listening, watching, seeing, reading, and playing media.
* Communicating persuasively with audio, image, and text. You’ll have opportunities to compose both with and about each of these media.
* Building a vocabulary for engaging media and fiction from the 20th and 21st centuries.  
* Making a simple website and some content for it. No worries if you’ve never made your own site. I’ll provide you with examples and templates, and I will assume no experience in web design or content management.

These four aims should apply to work across disciplines and occupations.

# Background

My name is Jentery Sayers. I’m an associate professor of English and Cultural, Social, and Political Thought (CSPT), and I direct the Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies. I've been at UVic since 2011, and I did my PhD at the University of Washington. Most of my work is in the field of comparative media studies. I teach courses on American fiction, cultural studies, media, and prototyping. 

This course has a history (since 2009 or so) of combining media concepts with media practice. The content is grounded in the humanities, but with questions relevent to the arts and sciences, too. I've taught the course numerous times in the past. I find the humanities to be central to matters of media and technology because they demonstrate how history, fiction, language, and culture are fundamental to not only innovation (or the combination of critical and experimental work) but also values-oriented design (how stuff is made, by whom, and for whom). Pedagogically, I like to anchor inquiry in how "this becomes that": how, for instance, media are composed and then change conceptually and materially over time. This means we'll combine abstractions (ideas, norms, structures) with attention to both action (intepretation, prototyping, composition) and particulars (details, situations, substance) in this course. It also means we'll ask "how, when, and why?" as well as "what next, and under what assumptions?" 

# Structure

I've designed this course to unfold through a series of modules or "chunks" of content. I hope this design provides you with a framework for approaching the course topics and planning ahead.   

* "What Are Media?": on defining audio, image, text and their relation to fiction    
* "Making a Website": on using HTML and CSS to compose and publish audio, images, and text 
* "Media Aesthetics": on evaluating how we sense and make sense of media and fiction  
* "Audio in Fiction": on ways of listening to and playing fiction 
* "Images in Fiction": on ways of seeing, watching, and playing fiction 
* "Text in Fiction": on ways of reading and playing fiction 
* "Prototyping with Media and Fiction": on speculations informed by media aesthetics 
* "Remembering Media": on what we did and learned this term 

We’ll meet twice each week. The course will combine lectures and class discussions with workshops. I will often dedicate an entire meeting to a workshop, where you’ll respond to prompts and worksheets I’ll distribute. The prompts will guide your study and practice of media, including how you make your own content with audio, image, and text.

# Materials

# Assignments

I’m asking you to:

* Keep a log / journal of your work, marked at the middle and end of term (each of these two marks will be 25% of your final grade)
* Submit worksheets for four workshops (each 5% of your mark)
* Take an exam at the end of term (30% of your final mark)

I will provide you with prompts for each of these assignments. Except for the exam, which you'll submit to me in person, all of the assignments will be submitted online. You'll create a URL and website (public or private) for your log, and the worksheets will be online forms. 

There are no essays or presentations required for this course.

# Notes 

As the term unfolds, I will share in this section notes and reflections from lectures and workshops. Expect new content here almost every week of class. These notes should help you to develop your log and prepare for the final exam.  

### Definitions

Here are some definitions of key terms used to engage media and fiction in this course. Each definition is but one among many possibilities. (These are not *the* definitions.) After "media" and "fiction," they are alphabetized.   
 
* **Fiction**: a work of audio, image, and/or text that imagines, if only in part, its character(s), world(s), and/or events(s); has a story that's arranged with narrative; may be read, watched, played, seen, and/or heard
* **Media**: congealed labour or techniques made durable; not "the media" (singular) or "mass media" of the communications industry; three primary examples in this course are audio, image, and text 
* **Apparatus**: a mechanism used to measure media and fiction and also economize people's experiences; examples in this course include editors, grids, engines, stacks, and networks 
* **Audio**: a congealed way of hearing and composing; at once process and thing                          
* **Format**: a way to nest, circulate, or store media; examples include novels, comics, games, and radio            
* **Genre**: when fiction congeals into recognizable conventions accompanied by audience expectations; may become someone's preferred way of reading; classic examples are tragedy or comedy, but other examples include fantasy, science fiction, detective, slapstick, romance, action, adventure, horror, mystery, simulation, role-playing, and suspense     
* **Image**: a congealed way of seeing and composing; at once process and thing
* **Labour**: what congeals in media but cannot be recorded completely by it; the activities people individually and collectively perform to produce work; examples include emotional, mental, physical, sensual, manual, and machine labour  
* **Narrative**: how the story in a work of fiction is structured and arranged    
* **Norms**: worldviews that fiction and media both reproduce and resist; ideologies that discipline perception, the production of knowledge, and social and cultural practice; necessarily exclude some ways of hearing, seeing, reading, and composing in favour of other ways   
* **Play**: a negotiation or experiment with the meanings, materials, and modes of media and fiction; need not involve explicit rules; also the primary way of engaging games
* **Prototype**: a possibility presented through media and fiction; associated terms include sketch, scenario, wireframe, experiment, and draft; not a real or finished product with a brand; usually doesn't involve post-production   
* **Story**: the setting(s), plot, character(s), conflict(s), and point(s) of view in a work of fiction
* **Style**: what people say is unique about how a given person or group composes with audio, images, and/or text; an artist's or author's "signature"   
* **Technology**: a system, such as phonography, photography, print, and computing, that reproduces media; usually involves automation  
* **Text**: a congealed way of reading and composing; at once process and thing   
* **Work**: an output or result of labour, such as a work of fiction; not just an object or thing, but its content and the processes that went into making and circulating it 

Again, these definitions are not exhaustive. I provide them to render transparent the assumptions of this course and my approaches to it. Equally important, definitions are often quite fuzzy or contingent with history and culture. They are more like guides for situations than answers to important questions, and they should be approached with a healthy dose of skepticism. What's missing from them? What do people want from them? What makes them work? I therefore hope you'll question and revise these definitions rather than adopting them wholesale for deployment in this course or elsewhere.  

### Why Media?

What is the point of studying media and fiction together in the 2020s? Consider the list. It translates how this course applies generally to the practice of communication and specifically to its analytical, structural, social, cultural, and practical dimensions. None of these applications is restricted to the academy. 

Approaching media and fiction together attends to matters of: 

* **Situation**, or the *context of communication*, including how, when, and where people relate and collaborate through particular media and/or fictions. 
* **Composition**, or the *content of communication*, including what people read, see, hear, watch, and play in particular media and/or fictions. 
* **Audience**, or the *purpose of communication*, including what people need, want, and/or expect from particular media and/or fictions. 
* **Norms**, or the *values of communication*, including what people deem to be credible, compelling, biased, predictable, or problematic about particular media and/or fictions. 
* **Novelty**, or the *uniqueness of communication*, including how and why particular media and/or fiction are considered to be innovative, disruptive, experimental, or generic. 
* **Engagement**, or the *experience of communication*, including what people feel and remember about particular media and/or fiction. 
* **Design**, or the *interface of communication*, including what people notice and ignore and how they navigate content and context. 

Perhaps a bit cheesy, but I use the acronym **SCANNED** to remember this list and to state succinctly why people might approach media and fiction together. I'll use the course modules to demonstrate how.

### The 20 M's

This term I'll use 20 m's to facilitate our study of media and fiction. The list is a guide, not a set of instructions, and will inevitably fall apart with some practice and pressure. I avoid common dichotomies between mind and body, logic and feeling, and analysis and experience, mostly because such dichotomies are driven by norms or ideals frequently critiqued within media and literary studies. Although there's an order to the outline, with "Apprehension" appearing first, it's not a hierarchy or series of steps. The "Evaluation" section may prompt revisions to "Synthesis," for example, or some people may wish to start with "Comprehension." I use "work" throughout the guide to refer to a work of fiction and its media (audio, image, and text), and I encourage repeated description to render the process as approachable as possible. Suggestions welcome.  

**Apprehension** 

"What's happening here?" Apprehension is about impressions, sensations, and evocations. It's about the moment, which may be familiar. "I've felt this before." While experience may feel personal, it's social, too. It's structured by media and fiction, and it's shaped by design.   

* Describe the *materials* used. 
* Describe the *modes* or senses engaged. 
* Describe the *mood* inhabited or experienced. 

Consider recording or annotating your (initial) engagement in real time (like an unboxing video or Let's Play), if only for your own records. With express consent, you might do the same for someone else and then compare your results. Account for eye rolls and anxious feelings as well: what's off-putting, predictable, unclear, discomfiting, frustrating . . . Apprehension isn't necessarily appreciation.   

**Comprehension** 

"What's this about?" Comprehension is about expressions, understanding, and situating things. It's about making sense after the fact&mdash;identifying and arranging the parts. While it may feel impersonal, it's nevertheless motivated. People usually want meaning and even purpose from media and fiction. 

* Describe the *modules* or parts of the work. 
* Describe the units used to *measure* the work and its parts.  
* Describe the *main content* of the story (who, what, when, and where).
* Describe the work's history, its network, and its *moment* of composition (who, what, when, and where). 

Consider distilling the work, reflecting on it, and even graphing its parts, story, and/or relation to other works in its network. Note how and when these practices are about control, or the pleasure of making sense of things. When is control problematic? What do graphs or classifications get wrong? 

**Synthesis** 

"How does it all come together?" Synthesis is about boundaries and relations. It entwines apprehension with comprehension. It connects materials with abstractions and personal experiences with structures and designs. It's never total or complete; it can't and shouldn't account for all the things.  

* Describe how (you assume) the work was *made*. 
* Get *meta*. Describe how the story is told.
* Describe what the work *means* (or its multiple, incongruous *meanings*). 
* Describe how it *massages* or *manipulates* people's senses.
* Describe how people *move* with, within, across, and beyond it. 
* Describe what *motivates* people to return to and/or identify with it. 
* Describe how it and responses to it have *morphed* over time. 
* Describe how it is or would be collected and *maintained* over time. 

Consider taking notes for each of these but developing a response to just one or two. Otherwise, the process may be overwhelming. 

**Evaluation** 

"So what?" Evaluation is about assessment, or why people should care about the work and engagements with it. Evaluations have intended audiences; knowing that audience and their expectations focuses the inquiry. 

* Describe how the work *mediates* its relation to power and "common sense" (norms, assumed knowledge, and congealed ways of perceiving). 
* Describe who and what it *misses*, ignores, or essentializes.  
* Describe the *memories* it elicits and how it elicits them. 
* Describe how it functions as *mimesis* (show, drama) and diegesis (tell, narrative) within and against its network.  

Again, consider taking notes for each of these but developing a response to just one or two. A response may not be an essay or series of paragraphs. Compose with audio, image, and/or text to determine what sticks with you and/or what others deem to be most compelling.  

**Action** 

"What to do about it all?" Action is about learning and intervention: what people do with a work of media and fiction they encounter and study. Perhaps they do nothing with it. Preferring not to is indeed a sort of action. But so are improving the work, responding to it, integrating it into a project, discussing it with others, and drawing motivation from it. "Active learning" assumes many forms.  

* *Mobilize* the work: change it, prototype with it, teach it, critique it, exhibit it, write about it. 

Consider how a given work of media and fiction intersects with your own interests and trajectories and then determine how to communicate these intersections to (or with) other people. 

### Apparatuses

Approaches to media in fiction rely heavily on how media are measured: how they are divided into components and then isolated, traversed, compared, contrasted, and the like. These components are not the inevitable output of technologies. They are decisions with histories, norms, and expectations. That is, they are made and used often, they have conventions, and people want or assume particular experiences from them. They are also entwined with disciplines and discourses, such as how people talk about games, comics, radio, and books. A mechanism for their production may be called an "apparatus."

An apparatus is not exactly a form or template. It's a relation machine. It helps people to sense and make sense of media in fiction&mdash;to measure media, build vocabularies for media, and move between, within, across, beyond, and to media.

Here's a list of five apparatuses at play in this course. After each, I mention some components they produce and some relations they enable. I imagine a few of the terms may be unfamiliar, but I define the terms in later modules, such as "Audio in Fiction," "Images in Fiction," and "Text in Fiction." Thanks for your patience.   

* **The Grid**: produces panels and gutters in comics; columns, margins, headers, and lexia on pages; and snap guides in design software; relations premised on flatness, surface, sequence, syntax, scanning, and juxtaposition
* **The Stack**: produces a front end and back end as well as presentation, logic, and database layers; relations premised on depth, dependencies, access, and visibility 
* **The Network**: produces paths, maps, branches, and nodes; relations premised on links, forks, paradigms, and wandering 
* **The Editor**: produces tracks, segments, fades, cuts, splices, wipes, and effects; relations premised on ellipsis, sequence, condensing, synchronization, and simultaneity 
* **The Engine**: produces worlds, theatres, and models; relations premised on programming, simulation, immersion, and immediacy  

These apparatuses of course intersect. Any given web project, for instance, may involve all of them. Equally interesting, an apparatus may not be explicit in people's engagements with media. The lines of a grid or the graphs for a network rarely appear on page or screen, and an engine usually wants people to forget they're inside a program or world. An apparatus is thus more like an interface. It's there, with palpable consequences; it's just not tangible or tactile.   

An apparatus has clear implications for design, yet it's relevant to studies of fiction, too. If an apparatus is a relation machine, then those relations likely congeal with repeated and collocated use, understood in fiction as genre. Here's another list, then. It uses prepositions to mark relations enabled by apparatuses and then experiments with those prepositions to describe components and experiences common in particular genres, which I italicize. 

* **At (spectacle)**: privileges the coherence of audio, image, and/or text into a single presentation; the story matters less than the experience; spectacles are common in *action and adventure*   
* **Within (worldbuilding)**: privileges the configuration of audio, image, and/or text as components in a system with rules or conventions; a story is played or inhabited; worldbuilding is common in *fantasy, science fiction, and roleplaying*        
* **Between (texture)**: privileges friction or tension between components of audio, image, and/or text; a story emerges from play or ambiguity and may promise resolution; texture is common in *strategy, comedy, and detective fiction*   
* **Across (deferral)**: privileges the use of audio, image, and/or text to make promises and then postpone delivery; the story thrives on what is or could be next; deferral is common in *mystery, horror, thrillers, and suspense*   
* **Beyond (epic)**: privileges pointing to audio, image, and/or text found elsewhere; the story is part of and refers to something larger; epic is common in *sagas, encyclopedic fiction, and historical fiction* 
* **To (address)**: privileges interpellation (hey you!) or identification (it me!) via components of audio, image, and/or text; address is common in *simulation and coming-of-age fiction*    

These aren't recipes for genres, and this isn't an exercise in totalization (as if one list could capture all the things). It's simply a starting point for approaching media in fiction through an apparatus. I return to the notion of genre later in this course. For now, I'll repeat here my definition of it: "genre: when fiction congeals into recognizable conventions accompanied by audience expectations; may become someone's preferred way of reading." The apparatus of media, or how they're measured, shapes these conventions and expectations.

# Policies 

Here are policies for the course. I'll review each of them during our first meeting, but please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions or concerns about them. 

### Prerequisites 

There are no prerequisites for this course. It is open to all undergraduate students at UVic. 
  
### Assessment 

The final exam and one half of your log are required to pass this course. Failure to complete these two assignments will result in a failing N grade (calculated as a 0 for your GPA). 

I will use UVic's [undergraduate grading scale](https://web.uvic.ca/calendar2020-01/undergrad/info/regulations/grading.html) to produce rubrics for each assignment and assess your work. I do not post marks outside my office, and I do not use plagiarism detection software.

### Late Submissions and Extensions

If you need to request an extension or you're concerned about the possibility of a late submission, then please email me. I recommend that you do not fall behind on any assignment, if possible, but I understand that extensions may be necessary for numerous reasons. 

### Communications 

The best way to communicate with me is in person, either by appointment or during my office hours, which are Mondays, 1-3pm, in CLE D334. You are also welcome to email me at jentery@uvic.ca. I respond to work email between 9am and 5pm, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.  

You are also welcome to communicate with Yu-Hsuan, Faith, and Ian in person or by email or appointment. TAs for this course are able to provide guidance on your work, but please see me with any questions about your marks and how assignments are assessed. 

### Feedback 

Yu-Hsuan, Faith, Ian, and I will provide feedback on your logs. We'll do so in writing, and feedback will be distributed in person during class. I will provide feedback in person, by appointment, on your exam. 

Throughout the term, I'll request feedback (verbal and in writing) from you on how the course is going. I'll also ask you to complete Course Experience Surveys at the end of the term (during our last meeting). 

### Attendance and Participation

Weekly attendance in undergraduate courses is expected. If you must miss class, then please notify me ahead of time by email. Cases of continuous, unexplained absence may negatively affect your grade, log, exam, and performance in workshops. Attendance and active participation in discussions and workshops are part of fulfilling the course requirements. 

### Laptops and Mobile Devices 

Laptops and mobile devices are welcome in (but not required for) this course. 

### Learning Climate  

The University of Victoria is committed to promoting, providing, and protecting a positive, supportive, and safe working and learning environment for all its members. You and I are expected to adhere to [UVic's equity and human rights policies](https://www.uvic.ca/equity/). You should alert me immediately if you have any questions about these policies and their application, or if you have concerns about course proceedings or participants.

### Academic Integrity  

You and I are expected to adhere to [UVic's academic integrity policy](https://www.uvic.ca/current-students/home/academics/academic-integrity/index.php) and be aware of the policies for the evaluation of student course work. Violations of the integrity policy will result in a failing grade for the given assignment and may additionally result in a failing grade for the course. By taking this course, you agree that all submitted assignments may be subject to an originality review. I do not use software to detect plagiarism in essays or any other assignments.

### Accessibility and Accommodation 

Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. In particular, if you have a disability or health consideration that may require accommodations, please feel free to approach me and/or the [Centre for Accessible Learning (CAL)](https://www.uvic.ca/services/cal/) as soon as possible. CAL staff are available by appointment to assess specific needs, provide referrals, and arrange appropriate accommodations. The sooner you let us know your needs, the quicker we can assist you in achieving your learning goals in this course.

### Basic Needs 

I want you to thrive in this course and everywhere else. Please let me know as early as possible if you have any concerns or if you require any assistance to succeed. I’ll do my best to help.

If you need to cover gaps in care, then please don't hesitate to bring your children to seminar. Babies who are nursing are always welcome, as I do not want you to choose between feeding your child and continuing your education. 

UVic takes student mental health very seriously, with a [website](https://www.uvic.ca/mentalhealth/) full of resources. We offer services such as assistance and referral to address students' personal, social, career, and study skills concerns. Services for students also include crisis and emergency mental health consultation and confidential assessment, counselling services (individual and small group), and referrals. Many of these programs are connected with Health Services, which is located at the Petersen Health Centre (Lower Parking Lot #5, off Sinclair Road, behind the residence cafeteria). Many offices have walk-in hours as well as appointments. 

The [Student Services website](https://www.uvic.ca/studentaffairs/departments/student-services/index.php) lists several policies that you might want to know about and may make your life at UVic safer and easier. Only some of them are directly related to this seminar, but they're still important.
