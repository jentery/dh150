# Voice-over 

Voice-over may be defined as what's said by a speaker who is either not seen or is communicating from a moment before or after what's being seen. While many definitions of voice-over are preoccupied with the "location" of the narrator (e.g., "non-diegetic" sounds or narration, which do not occur within the "world" of the story), it's perhaps more productive to treat voice-over as yet another audio element of a work. Voice-over links voice with other sounds as well as with text and images. The speaker often recounts events happening on screen (or within a frame) and/or provides perspective or understanding for those events. Voice-over is common in the use of flashbacks and dream sequences, for instance. 

Here are some ways to approach what voice-over is doing in a given work: 

* Exposition, where the narrator describes what's seen or happening, often by providing background or contextual information (e.g., [*Barry Lyndon*](https://youtu.be/3_qW-xPanqU?t=54) and [*Amelie*](https://youtu.be/3_qW-xPanqU?t=62)) 
* Recollection, where the narrator recalls and perhaps reflects on events in which they participated (e.g., [*Kind Hearts and Coronets*](https://youtu.be/3_qW-xPanqU?t=34))
* Privileged access, where the narrator tells the audience something they either may not or do not say to other characters; or, the narrator conveys something either audiences are not seeing or characters do not know or perceive (e.g., [*Trainspotting*](https://youtu.be/3_qW-xPanqU?t=25) and [*Y Tu Mamá También*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=57))
* Meta, where the narrator comments on the narration or the act of narration; sometimes the characters talk back to the narrator (e.g., [*The Opposite of Sex*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk), [*George of the Jungle*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=92), and [*Hot Shots! Part Deux*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=110)) 
* Testimony, where the narrator serves as a witness to events and may even represent them by speaking on their behalf (e.g., [*Blade Runner*](https://youtu.be/3_qW-xPanqU?t=152))
* Direct address, where the narrator speaks directly to the audience, often as a character, breaking the "fourth wall" (e.g., [*Ferris Bueller's Day Off*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=163), [*Fight Club*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=163), and [*Deadpool*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=163))
* Disruption, where the narrator intervenes actively in the composition or story, usually with a notable effect on flow or rhythm (e.g., [*Bande à part*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=42))
* Command or direction, where the narrator makes something appear or occur on screen (e.g., [*The Wolf of Wall Street*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=83) and [*George of the Jungle*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=92))
* Commentary, where the narrator remarks on what's seen or happening, often for comedic or manipulative purposes (e.g., [*The Big Lebowski*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=142) and [*Sunset Blvd.*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=29))
* Knowledge gap, where the narrator's descriptions suggest they may not follow or fully grasp what's seen or happening (e.g., [*Badlands*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=200))
* Autonomy, where voice-over and image run in parallel, without the need for synchronization or cohesion (e.g., [*The Thin Red Line*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=224))

The voice-over may be recognized for the "grain" of its voice (its signature) or the "voice" of the grain (the signature or trace of a sound recording on wax, vinyl, tape, etc.). Finally, people often want to hear themselves in voices (see the story of Echo and Narcissus). What assumptions are at play in such desires? 

I'm borrowing some of this language from Sarah Kozloff, Linda Martín Alcoff, Michel Chion, and Roland Barthes.
