# Workshop on Mimesis, Images, and Fiction

Isolating what is narrated (diegesis) and what is shown (mimesis) in a work of fiction can reveal interesting things about the narrator, their experiences, their reliability, and the world they inhabit. 

For this workshop, we’re asking you to experiment with this isolation. We’ll give you a page, titled “The Cootie Step,” from Emil Ferris’s *My Favorite Thing Is Monsters*. We'd like you to annotate it. More specifically, we'd like you to use annotations to *diagram and describe* what various elements of the page are showing and/or telling. 

If you've never annotated a comic, then we recommend reviewing [these examples](http://spinweaveandcut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/vis-analysis-examples-smaller.pdf) for ideas and approaches. Annotations are often colour-coded. You could, for instance, assign one colour to diegesis and another colour to mimesis. 

The emphasis here is on observation. How much can you notice about this page from Karen’s diary? How is it made? How "faithful" is it to actuality? What's being conveyed through images? Through narration? Where is there tension between the images and the text?

You can submit this assignment *individually or in pairs*. If you work in pairs, then each of you will receive the same mark (5% of your final grade).  

Please submit your annotated copy of “The Cootie Step” to us in class on **Monday, March 2nd**. Don’t forget to put your name(s) on it.

This prompt was written by Faith Ryan and Jentery Sayers, with material drawn from work by [Nick Sousanis](http://spinweaveandcut.com/). Thanks, Nick!
